<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Diego Flores Moreno, born on March 21, 2002. I am proudly from the northern region, originally from Saltillo, Coahuila.
</p>

<p> Currently, I am studying industrial engineering at the University of the Americas Puebla. I live as a foreign student in a very nice apartment. I'd be happy to invite you over whenever you want.

  I really enjoy cooking and dancing. My favorite dish is Carne Asada with guacamole and flour tortillas. As for dancing, I enjoy cumbia, salsa, northern dances, and huapangos. In terms of music, I really like northern music and banda, although I also listen to boleros, sones, and mariachi. Something I don't like is commercial reggaeton. <br/>
  
Additionally, I would like to mention that I played the saxophone for a while. I would also love to learn to play the accordion.
